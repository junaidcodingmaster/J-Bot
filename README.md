# A Robot [J-Bot]

This is an 3D model that is created by using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io).

- **`J-Bot`** : Junaid's Bot or Junaid's Robot.

And This is my project.

In this project, I've crafted a 3D model and added:

- **360Â° Lighting** to beautifully showcase my creation.
- **3D metallic surface texture** for a futuristic look.
- **Custom Textures** , just see your self in `./img` folder .

## Theme

Here, I combined

- cyberpunk (5%) with
- eco-friendly Earth (75%) and
- The idea of robots sacrificing themselves to get us safe [In wars] (20%)
- Total = 100%.
- The color palette features green and blue.

## Inspiration

I got inspiration from "Wall-E" and "Interstellar" movies , where robots play a crucial role in space exploration.
